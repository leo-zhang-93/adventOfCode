# adventOfCode
this is the repo to store my python code for Advent of Code.

It's a popular annual event where programmers solve a series of coding puzzles, released daily during the Advent calendar season. It's a great way to practice problem-solving, algorithm design, and programming skills in a fun and challenging way.
